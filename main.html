	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?
			</h1>
		<p>I want to be a software developer because designing computer programs lets me use my creative and problem-solving skills. Software development wasn't my initial career path, but I'm glad I discovered it. In college, I originally studied Digital communications. After obtaining my bachelor's degree in Electronics communications.I searched for something more fulfilling.I'm excited to begin a career as a software developer and learn more about this line of work from industry professionals.
